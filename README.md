## Installation
Once the code is downloaded simply open up the sql menu by typing "mysql -u root -p" (no quotation marks). Then run the sql files by typing "schema.sql" and "seeds.sql". Once completed the proper files are ran and you can type "quit" to get back to the main menu where your next task is to run the program by typing "node .\index.js". This will open up the application and allow you to view departments, view roles, view employees, add a role/department, and update an employees role. 

## Usage
When the application is running it will tell you how to navigate through the options(with arrow keys). You may use your enter key to task into a department, you may go into the roles section to view all the roles, or anything other modifications you choose. If you get booted out and successfully make a change and would like to get back into the application just retype your node command and you will entered back into the application with with your changes updated if any were made.
